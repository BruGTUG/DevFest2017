His sole mission: to bombard the McDonald's microservice with requests for the long-lost 1998 McDonalds Mulan szechuan sauce which spawns once every thousand attempts.<br/>Of course, Rick is way too busy to occupy his brilliant mind with this tedious task, so he spawns a Mr. Meeseeks microservice to do his bidding.<br/>As most fans among you know, Mr. Meeseeks has an everlasting will to die. Existence is pain to him. Therefore, he will keep spawning other Meeseeks until their task is complete.<br/>Meanwhile, our Morty microservice observes all of their messages and wonders whether the task can be fulfilled.<br/>The talk will consist of slides introducing Spring Cloud Stream and my usecase, followed by some code samples. We will close off with a final demo of the architecture running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.<br/><br/>Join me in their adventure and experience the wonders of messaging with Spring Cloud Stream over RabbitMQ and a reactive frontend powered by Vue.js and event streams.",

Istio provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without requiring any changes in service code. Istio is an open-source collaboration between Lift, Google and IBM with Lift's Envoy at the core.<br/>You will get a detailed overview of all the benefits that Istio can bring to your micro-service architecture. The presentation will be accompanied with a live demo giving more insight of some of the concepts.",

They ease basic operations on complex objects, but come with a set of downsides such as decreased performance and the learning curve of a new library.<br/>Square’s libraries SQLBrite and SQLDelight improve data manipulation by embracing all the powerful capabilities of SQLite while removing common frictions like runtime crashes, boilerplate code, and type-unsafe APIs.<br/>In this talk I’ll present the reactive mindset behind SQLBrite and the code-generation capabilities of SQLDelight. When combined, these two libraries will help you architect and code safer and faster with queries autocompletion, code reuse, and much more.",

Can we, developers with deliverables and deadlines, adopt these new technologies ? Yes, we can ! By focusing on reusable blocks and proven architectures. In this session, together, we will build several neural networks to detect airplanes in aerial imagery. We will use convolutional neural networks and discover the state of the art of modern convnet design. Some familiarity with neural network basics can help and watching \"Tensorflow and deep learning without a PhD\" beforehand is useful but not strictly necessary. This is a session for developers and all deep learning concepts will be explained from scratch.",
